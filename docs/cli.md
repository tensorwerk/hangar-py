Hangar CLI Documentation
========================

The CLI described below is automatically available after the Hangar
Python package has been installed (either through a package manager or
via source builds). In general, the commands require the terminals `cwd`
to be at the same level the repository was initially created in.

Simply start by typing `$ hangar --help` in your terminal to get
started!
