    "of checkouts (each of which have different uses and abilities):\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Checking out a branch / commit for reading:](api.rst#read-only-checkout)** is \n",
    "the process of retrieving records describing repository state at some point in \n",
    "time, and setting up access to the referenced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Any number of read checkout processes can operate on a repository (on\n",
    "   any number of commits) at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Checking out a branch for writing:](api.rst#write-enabled-checkout)** is the \n",
    "process of setting up a (mutable) ``staging area`` to temporarily gather \n",
    "record references / data before all changes have been made and staging area \n",
    "contents are committed in a new permanent record of history (a `commit`).\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Only one write-enabled checkout can ever be operating in a repository\n",
    "   at a time.\n",
    "-  When initially creating the checkout, the `staging area` is not\n",
    "   actually “empty”. Instead, it has the full contents of the last `commit`\n",
    "   referenced by a branch’s `HEAD`. These records can be removed / mutated / added\n",
    "   to in any way to form the next `commit`. The new `commit` retains a\n",
    "   permanent reference identifying the previous ``HEAD`` ``commit`` was used as\n",
    "   its base `staging area`.\n",
    "-  On commit, the branch which was checked out has its ``HEAD`` pointer\n",
    "   value updated to the new `commit`’s `commit_hash`. A write-enabled\n",
    "   checkout starting from the same branch will now use that `commit`’s\n",
    "   record content as the base for its `staging area`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a branch\n",
    "\n",
    "A branch is an individual series of changes / commits which diverge from the main\n",
    "history of the repository at some point in time. All changes made along a branch\n",
    "are completely isolated from those on other branches. After some point in time,\n",
    "changes made in a disparate branches can be unified through an automatic\n",
    "`merge` process (described in detail later in this tutorial). In general, the\n",
    "`Hangar` branching model is semantically identical to the `Git` one; The one exception\n",
    "is that in Hangar, a branch must always have a `name` and a `base_commit`. (No \n",
    "\"Detached HEAD state\" is possible for a `write-enabled` checkout). If No `base_commit` is \n",
    "specified, the current writer branch `HEAD` `commit` is used as the `base_commit` \n",
    "hash for the branch automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hangar branches have the same lightweight and performant properties which \n",
    "make working with `Git` branches so appealing - they are cheap and easy to use,\n",
    "create, and discard (if necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a branch, use the [create_branch()](api.rst#hangar.repository.Repository.create_branch)\n",
