    "   any number of commits) at the same time.\n",

    "   at a time\n",
    "-  When initially creating the checkout, the ``staging area`` is not\n",
    "   actually “empty”. Instead, it has the full contents of the last ``commit``\n",
    "   referenced by a branch’s ``HEAD``. These records can be removed/mutated/added\n",
