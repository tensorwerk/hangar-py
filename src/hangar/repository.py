        Since a branch (by definition) is the name associated with the HEAD
        commit of a historical path, the default behavior of this method is to
        throw an exception (no-op) should the ``HEAD`` not be referenced as an
        ancestor (or at least as a twin) of a separate branch which is
        currently *ALIVE*. If referenced in another branch's history, we are
        assured that all changes have been merged and recorded, and that this
        pointer can be safely deleted without risk of damage to historical
        provenance or (eventual) loss to garbage collection.

        It is important to note that *while this method will handle all safety
        checks, argument validation, and performs the operation to permanently
        delete a branch name/digest pointer, **no commit refs along the history
        will be deleted from the Hangar database**.* Most of the history contains
        commit refs which must be safe in other branch histories, and recent
        commits may have been used as the base for some new history. As such, even
        if some of the latest commits leading up to a deleted branch ``HEAD`` are
        orphaned (unreachable), the records (and all data added in those commits)
        will remain on the disk.

        In the future, we intend to implement a garbage collector which will remove
        orphan commits which have not been modified for some set amount of time
        (probably on the order of a few months), but this is not implemented at the
        moment.

        Should an accidental forced branch deletion occur, *it is possible to
        recover* and create a new branch head pointing to the same commit. If
        the commit digest of the removed branch ``HEAD`` is known, its as simple as
        specifying a name and the ``base_digest`` in the normal
        :meth:`create_branch` method. If the digest is unknown, it will be a
        bit more work, but some of the developer facing introspection tools /
        routines could be used to either manually or (with minimal effort)
        programmatically find the orphan commit candidates. If you find
        yourself having accidentally deleted a branch, and must get it back,
        please reach out on the `Github Issues
        <https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py/issues>`__ page. We'll gladly
        explain more in depth and walk you through the process in any way we
        can help!

        ----------
        name : str
            name of the branch which should be deleted. This branch must exist, and
            cannot refer to a remote tracked branch (ie. origin/devbranch), please

            argument
        force_delete : bool, optional
            If True, remove the branch pointer even if the changes are un-merged in
            other branch histories. May result in orphaned commits which may be
            time-consuming to recover if needed, by default False

        ------
        ValueError

            call.

            checkout, and whose contents form the base of the staging area.
        RuntimeError
            If the branch has not been fully merged into other branch histories,
