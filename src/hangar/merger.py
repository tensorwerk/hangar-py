"""Merge Methods

In the current implementation only fast-forward and a competent, but limited,
three-way merge algorithm are implemented. All user facing API calls should be
funneled through the :function:`select_merge_algorithm` function

!!! note

    In the current implementation, it is not possible to stop a merge in progress or
    to revert a bad merge commit. All revert like operations should be made by
    creating new branches from the last "good" state, after which new merge
    operations can be attempted (if desired.)

    Automatically selects algorithm and does the operation if no conflicts are

    Parameters
    ----------
    message : str
        user message describing the commit

    repo_path: Path
        path to the repository on disk
    writer_uuid : str, optional, kwarg only
        if the merge method is called from the repo level, the default writer
        lock `MERGE_PROCESS` is used to ensure that a writer is active. If
        called from within a write-enabled checkout, the writer lock is set to
        the writer_uuid of the writer checkout so that the lock can be acquired.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        if the staging area is not `CLEAN` of other changes
    PermissionError
        if the writer lock is currently held
    ValueError
        if a conflict is found in a three way merge, no operation will be performed.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        commit hash of the merge if this was a successful operation.
