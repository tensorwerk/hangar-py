`0.5.2`_ (2020-05-08)
=====================

New Features
------------

* New column data type supporting arbitrary ``bytes`` data.
  (`#198 <https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py/pull/198>`__) `@rlizzo <https://github.com/rlizzo>`__

Improvements
------------

* ``str`` typed columns can now accept data containing any unicode code-point. In prior releases
  data containing any ``non-ascii`` character could not be written to this column type.
  (`#198 <https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py/pull/198>`__) `@rlizzo <https://github.com/rlizzo>`__

  (`#179 <https://github.com/tensorwerk/hangar-py/pull/179>`__) `@rlizzo <https://github.com/rlizzo>`__
* Commit times and checkout times have been reduced by 11-18% by optimizing record parsing and
